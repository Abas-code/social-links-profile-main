## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to declare the same style(s) to multiple elements in CSS.

```css
footer, footer a { font-size: 14px; }
```

### Continued development

I want to learn how to use the variable font file not the static type.

### Useful resources
